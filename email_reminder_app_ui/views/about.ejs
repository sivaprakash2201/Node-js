<div class="card card-ghost p-4"><h2>About Email Reminder</h2>
<p>This app lets you schedule emails to be sent later. When you register you provide your email and a Gmail App Password (stored encrypted). A background job checks due reminders and uses your (decrypted) app password to send the email on your behalf.</p>
<p><strong>How it works (short):</strong> You register → schedule a reminder (single or multiple recipients) → cron job detects due reminders → app decrypts your mail app password and sends emails via Gmail → reminder marked as sent.</p></div>
